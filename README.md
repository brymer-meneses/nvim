# Neovim

This repository contains my neovim config.

Some parts of it are not mine including 
most configurations to Native LSP and some plugins which were taken from 
[LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim).
I'm also using [statusline](https://github.com/famiu/feline.nvim) config which was taken from 
[rafamadriz's config](https://github.com/rafamadriz/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/statusline)
