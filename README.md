# Neovim

This repository contains my neovim config.

Some parts of it are not mine including 
most configurations to Native LSP and some plugins which were taken from 
[LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim).
I'm also using a [statusline](https://github.com/glepnir/galaxyline.nvim) config which was taken and modified from 
[disrupted's config](https://github.com/disrupted/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim/lua/conf/statusline.lua)
